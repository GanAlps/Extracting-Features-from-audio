MARSYAS / QT TUTORIAL
--------------------

This is a simple example of a Qt application that uses Marsyas.  It is
a simplified version of MarPlayer, containing only a volume control
and position display.  It demonstrates passing information from the Qt
application to Marsyas, and getting information from Marsyas back to Qt.

To compile:

qmake
make
./runme file.wav
(the file to play must be specified on the command line;
 this program is as simple as I could make it!)


Files:
marqt.pro: project definition file for qmake.

main.cpp: contains a small "int main()".

mainwindow .h .cpp: defines the user interface; mostly simple Qt code.

backend .h .cpp: sets up the MarSystem and the Qt/MarSystem information flow.

MarSystemWrapper .h .cpp: these files are located in the parent
  directory and must be included.  These files are common to every
  Marsyas/Qt application; you don't need to understand them.
