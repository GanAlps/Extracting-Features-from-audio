BUILD REQUIREMENTS
- in most cases, you can just do "make html" or "make pdf"
- if you want to add more source examples (see below), you must have
    . GNU source-highlight   (it's packaged in Debian and fink)
      http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html
- if you want to create source documentation, you must have
    . Doxygen      (it's in Debian and fink)


Here are a few useful macros:
- @qq{text}: adds ``double quotes'' around text.  @qq looks better in HTML
   than using `` and ''.
- @examplefile{}: includes an example file from examples/.  This file
   must also be added to EXAMPLES in Makefile.am.
- @examplefilenewpage{}: include the example on a new HTML page (ie the
   manual just has a link to that page).  Use this if you have multiple
   files that are part of the same project (such as a qt4GUI).
