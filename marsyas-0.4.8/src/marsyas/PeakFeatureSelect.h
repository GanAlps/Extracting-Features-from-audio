	and allows to select which peak features should be sent to the output. 
	Used for similarity computations on peaks.  

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/selectedFeatures [rw] : bit field used to select peaks features to output
	- \b mrs_natural/totalNumPeaks [w] : this control sets the total num of peaks at the input (should normally be linked with PeakConvert similar control)
	- \b mrs_natural/frameMaxNumPeaks [w] : this control sets the maximum num of peaks per frame at the input (should normally be linked with PeakConvert similar control)
