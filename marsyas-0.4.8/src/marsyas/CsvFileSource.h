   \brief Reads CSV (comma-separated values) text files

    Input file is assumed to begin with a header (the intended
    observation names, separated by commas).  The rest of the file
    should consist of comma-separated values.  This functions
    similarly to Inject, except that it reads from a file instead
    of from a control; this can be useful to add metadata (from a
    file) to improve the machine learning.

   Controls:
   - \b mrs_string/filename [w] : name of file to read
   - \b mrs_bool/hasData [r] : is there any data left?
   - \b mrs_natural/size [r] : filesize in samples
