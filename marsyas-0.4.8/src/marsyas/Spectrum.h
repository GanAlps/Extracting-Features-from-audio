	\class Spectrum
	\ingroup Analysis
	\brief Compute the complex spectrum of input window

	Computes the complex spectrum (N/2+1 points) of the input window
	using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The output is
	a N-sized column vector (where N is the size of the input
	audio vector), using the following format:

	[Re(0), Re(N/2), Re(1), Im(1), Re(2), Im(2), ..., Re(N/2-1), Im(N/2-1)]

	Note that the DC and Nyquist frequencies only have real part,
	and are output as the two first coefficients in the vector.
	Overall, the output spectrum has N/2+1 unique points, corresponding
	to the positive half of the complex spectrum.

	\note Only the first observation input channel is processed,
	the rest (if any) is ignored.
