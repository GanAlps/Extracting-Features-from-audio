	\class LyonPassiveEar
	\ingroup Processing
	\brief Lyon filterbank

	Lyon Passive Ear computation. Based on 
	the code from the Auditory Toolbox by Malcolm Slaney. 

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/decimFactor [wr] : Decimation Factor - How much to decimate the model's output. 
		Normally the cochlear model produces one output per channel at each sample time. This 
		parameters allows the output to be decimated in time (using a filter to reduce aliasing. 
		See the decimTauFactor parameter.)
	- \b mrs_real/earQ [wr] : Quality Factor - The quality factor of a filter is a measure of its 
		bandwidth. In this case it measures the ratio of the width of each band-pass filter at a 
		point 3dB down from the maximum. Normally, critical band filters have a Q of about 8. 
		Smaller values of earQ mean broader cochlear filters
	- \b mrs_real/stepFactor [wr] :  Filter stepping factor - Each filter in a filter bank is 
		overlapped by a fixed fraction given by this parameter. The default value is given by 
		earQ/32. Thus normal filters (q=8) are overlapped by 25%.
	- \b mrs_bool/channelDiffActive [wr] : Channel Difference Flag - Adjacent filter channels can be 
		subtracted to further improve the model's frequency response. This parameter is a flag; 
		non-zero values indicate the channel differences should be computed.
	- \b mrs_bool/agcActive [wr] : Automatic Gain Control Flag - An automatic gain control is used 
		to model neural adaptation. This ?ag turns the adaptation mechanism on and off.
		- \b mrs_real/decimTauFactor [wr] : Filter Decimation Tau Factor - When the output of the cochlear 
		model is decimated, a low pass filter is applied to each channel to reduce the high frequency 
		content and minimize aliasing. The ?lter’s time constant (tau) is set to the decimation 
		factor multiplied by this argument. Larger values for the taufactor mean less high frequency 
		information is passed.
	- \b mrs_realvec/centerFreqs [r] : mid frequencies of the calculated filter bands.
