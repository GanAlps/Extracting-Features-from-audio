	\brief PeakPeriods2BPM: convert peaks to beats per minute.
	This block should have as input a vector with the peak amplitudes in its 
	pair indexes and the peak arguments (in frames) in its odd indexes.
	It was created to convert the input given by "MaxArgMax" which outputs the chosen
	number of peaks in the referred form.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/srcFs [w] : Input sampling rate of the sound file source 
	(given by "SoundFileSource/src/mrs_real/israte") -> by default = 1.0Hz.
	
	- \b mrs_natural/hopSize [w] : hopsize of the analysis -> by default = 1.
