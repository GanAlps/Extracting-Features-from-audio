	\ingroup Processing
	\brief Simple one-pole digital filter.

	OnePole implements the digital filter described by equation
		\f[ y(t) = (1 - \alpha) x(t) + \alpha  y(t - 1) \f]
	This filter has one pole at \f$ z = \alpha \f$.
	If \f$ \alpha > 0 \f$, the filter has a low-pass characteristic,
	the closer to 1 the smaller the pass band.
	If \f$ \alpha < 0 \f$, it has a high-pass characteristic,
	the closer to -1, the smaller the pass band.

	Note that the coefficient of \f$ x(t) \f$ is set to \f$ (1-\alpha) \f$
	to have unity gain for the DC component (both in the low pass and high
	pass case) as a sort of normalization.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/alpha [w]: the \f$ \alpha \f$ parameter in the filter equation.
