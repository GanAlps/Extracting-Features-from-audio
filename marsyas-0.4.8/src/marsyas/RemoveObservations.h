	Mainly used to remove bins from a PowerSpectrum which fall
outside the range of interest.  This MarSystem includes both
cutoff values; it rounds down for the lowCutoff, and rounds up for
the highCutoff.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/lowCutoff [w] : the lowest observation to
	  pass to output, as a decimal percent of the total number
	  of observations (default 0.0).
	- \b mrs_real/highCutoff [w] : the highest observation to
	  pass to output, as a decimal percent of the total number
	  of observations (default 1.0).
