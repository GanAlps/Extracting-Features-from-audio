	\class ArffFileSink
	\ingroup IO
	\brief Writes slices to a file in (Weka) ARFF format.

	ArffFileSink writes the input realvec data it receives to a file in ARFF
	format (Attribute-Relation File Format). The ARFF format is relatively easy
	and consists of a simple header, describing the observation channels
	(called 'attributes' in ARFF), and a straightforward data body.

	ARFF files are typically used with the Weka machine learning software.

	ArffFileSink is basically a simple rewrite of WekaSink. The problem with
	WekaSink is that it contains a fair amount of assumptions about the usage
	and purpose of the generated Weka files, which limits the flexibility of
	WekaSink. Fixing this in WekaSink without breaking backwards compatibility
	would be very hard and messy.

	\see WekaSink

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/floatPrecision [w]: the precision to use for the decimal
		notation.
	- \b mrs_natural/decimationFactor [w]: the decimation factor for data to
		file writing. Note that the flow from standard realvec input port to
		standard realvec output port is undecimated.
	- \b mrs_string/filename [w]: the name of the file to write to.
