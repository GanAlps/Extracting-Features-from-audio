	\ingroup Analysis
\brief Pick peaks out of signal 

Peaker is used to select peaks(or valleys) from the input vector. Various 
parameters of the peak selection process can be adjusted.

Controls:
- \b mrs_real/peakSpacing [w] : expressed in percentage of total vector length and is how much spacing you allow between the peaks
- \b mrs_real/peakStrength [w] : threshold compared to the RMS of the vector (should be renamed to peakStrengthRelRms to keep naming consistent, but this might break existing systems)
- \b mrs_real/peakStrengthAbs [w] : absolute threshold (might make sense e.g. for normalized spectra)
- \b mrs_real/peakStrengthRelMax [w] : threshold compared to global max of the vector (range: 0...1, example: 0.001 if all peaks with a level of more than 60dB below the maximum should be discarded
- \b mrs_real/peakStrengthRelThresh [w] : threshold compared to an adaptive threshold of the vector (lp filtered version of the signal); value is a factor that moves threshold up and down, e.g. value = 2 means that the lp filtered signal is moved up by 6dB
- \b mrs_real/peakStrengthTreshLpParam [w] : coefficient for the single pole lowpass for computing the adaptive threshold (between 0...1)
- \b mrs_natural/peakStart [w] : expressed in absolute positions of the vector and it just to adjust what part of the vector will be considered
- \b mrs_natural/peakEnd [w] : expressed in absolute positions of the vector length and it just to adjust what part of the vector will be considered
- \b mrs_natural/interpolation [w] : TODO - mlagrange? [!] 
- \b mrs_real/peakGain [w] : TODO - mlagrange? [!]
