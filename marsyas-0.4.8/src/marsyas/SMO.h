    \brief Support Vector Machine similar to the Weka implementation

    Support Vector Machine Classifier similar to the Weka implementation 
based on the Sequential Minimum Optimization (SMO) proposed by Platt. 
For now only the prediction part works and only for 2-class problems. 
Basically the machine is represented as a linear combination of 
attributes that represented the separating hyperplane. Currently I use 
weka for training.
