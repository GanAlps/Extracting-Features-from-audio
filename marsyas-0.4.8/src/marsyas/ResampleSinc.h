/** 
	\class ResampleSinc
	\ingroup Processing Basic
	\brief resamples all observations using a sum of sinc functions 
	wheareas each point is modeled by a sinc function with the given points amplitude, that is set to zero after the 5th zero crossing

	Normally this Marsystem expects as input samples witch are to be interpolated. 
	Multiple observations will be interpolated independently.

	Controls:
	mrs_bool ctrl_windowedMode	-	false:	apply sinc interpolation directly
									true:	(default) use values of Kaiser Window and interpolate linearly between them if necessary
	mrs_bool ctrl_samplingRateAdjustmentMode - adjust new resulting SamplingRate for following Marsystems
	mrs_real stretch - desired stretch ratio (number of output samples = input number of samples*stretch)
	mrs_real offStart - (default:0) offset from the start (towards the end) of the Samples (if only a part of the samples should be used to interpolate)
	mrs_real offEnd - (default:0) offset from the end (towards the start) of the Samples (if only a part of the samples should be used to interpolate)
