/** 
    \class Upsample
	\ingroup none
    \brief Upsample input realvec by integer factor using chosen interpolation. Frame size is also increased by the same factor.

		Upsamples a signal by a factor n so that out[t]=in[n*t]. Also runs some kind of interpolation to find out the value for unknown samples:
		"none": unknown samples are unchanged.
		"repeat": unknown sample [t] equals known sample [t+1]

         Controls:
         - \b mrs_natural/factor [w] : adjust the upsampling factor.
				 - \b mrs_string/mode [w] : change the interpolation mode. So far, you can use "none" or "repeat".
				 - \b mrs_float/default [w] : Unchanged values are set to this value.
