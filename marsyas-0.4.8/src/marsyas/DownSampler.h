	\class DownSampler
	\ingroup Processing Basic
	\brief Downsample the input signal by dropping samples.

	Downsample the signal by an integer factor N. The output of the DownSampler
	will only reproduce the input samples at multiples of N.

	Note that the DownSampler does not take care of any low pass filtering to
	avoid frequency aliasing.

	Note that the DownSampler restarts counting and dropping samples for every
	given slice. Consequently, if the number of input samples is not divisible
	by the downsample factor, the sampling will be not uniform around the slice
	borders.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/factor [w] : factor to downsample by.
