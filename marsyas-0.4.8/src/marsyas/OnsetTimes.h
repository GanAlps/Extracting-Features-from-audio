	Input: Supposed to have PeakerOnsets, or similar, as input.
	Output: [x|Phasei|x|Phasei+1|  ...  |x|PhaseM]

	- \b mrs_natural/n1stOnsets [w] : nr. of first detected onsets (= M phases).
	- \b mrs_natural/nPeriods [w] : nr. of considered period hypotheses (N) - to avoid Fanout crash (requires equal number of columns in each line)! 
	- \b mrs_natural/lookAheadSamples [w] : nr. of frames to adjust the lookahead used in PeakerOnset.
	- \b mrs_natural/tickCount [r] : current considered time (tick count) updated from BeatReferee.
