	\class Fanout
	\ingroup Composites
	\brief Fanout of MarSystem objects

	All the children Marsystems of this composite receive the same
	input and their outputs are stacked as rows of observations.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/disable [w] : passes in the number of the child
	MarSystem to disable.
	- \b mrs_natural/enable	[w] : pass in the number of the child MarSystem to
	enable.  (by default all children are enabled)
	- \b mrs_string/enableChild	[w] : pass in the type/name of the child MarSystem to
	enable.  (by default all children are enabled)
	- \b mrs_string/disableChild	[w] : pass in the type/name of the child MarSystem to
	disable.
  -\b mrs_realvec/enabled [r] : vector with the list of enabled (i.e. 1.0 valued) children
 (no point writing to this control - just use it for reading the current enable/disable status of children)
 -\b mrs_realvec/muted [rw] : vector with the list of muted (i.e. 1.0 valued) children. This control can be used
 to bypass processing of some children (which when muted just keep outputing the last computed result).
