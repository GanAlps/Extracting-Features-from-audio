	\class Sum
	\ingroup Processing Basic
	\brief Sum the input rows of observations into one row.

	Sum the input rows of observation into one row. Frequently
	used for mixing audio signals before SoudFileSink or AudioSink.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/stereo [w] : sum channels to stereo or mono
	- \b mrs_real/weight [w] : scales input to avoid clipping.
    - \b mrs_string/mode [w] : Sum over observations, samples or the whole realvec

    The "mode" string can be set to four different values:

    - "orig" -> The original behaviour of Sum, to sum all observations
      into one observation.  In this mode the "stereo" and "weight"
      flags work as they used to

    - "sum_observations" -> Sum up across observations.  Add up all
      the samples in an observation.

    - "sum_observations" -> Sum up across samples.  Add up all
      the observations for each sample.

    - "sum_whole" -> Sum up all the observations and samples of the
      realvec into a single number


	\todo Sum mrs_real/weight should be implemented as a meta-composite in
	marsystemmanager.  (?   -- lmartins said this)
