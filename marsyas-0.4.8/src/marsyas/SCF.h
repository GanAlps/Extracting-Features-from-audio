\brief Spectral Crest Factor

Spectral Crest Factor is a feature set very similar to the
Spectral Flatness Measure defined in the MPEG-7 audio standard.
Although it is not defined in the MPEG7 standard, its calculation
is here based on the same definitions used for the MPEG7 SFM:
1/4 octave frequency resolution, resulting in 24 frequency bands between
250Hz and 16kHz.
Based on code provided by Luis Gustavo Martins <lmartins@inescporto.pt>
