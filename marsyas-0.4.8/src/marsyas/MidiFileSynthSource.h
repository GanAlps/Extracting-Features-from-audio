	   \class MidiFileSynthSource
	   \ingroup IO
	   \brief Reads a MIDI file and synthesizes audio (needs MATLAB and
	   the MIDI Toolbox) 
   
	   MidiFileSynthSource makes use of the MIDI Toolbox for MATLAB
	   (see http://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/miditoolbox/ )
	   using the MATLABengine. It takes a midi file and synthesizes the
	   corresponding audio. Both the mixed audio and each MIDI
	   channel audio is output (the mixed audio is the first observation, while
	   the following observations have the audio of each MIDI track, individually
	   (this may be usefull for ground truth purposes). For each output audio frame
	   is also returned the number of playing MIDI notes (computed from the midi
	   data).
	 	 
	 
	   Controls:
	   - \b mrs_string/filename [w] : name of the MIDI file to read and synthesize
	   - \b mrs_natural/numActiveNotes [r] : number of playing notes at the current
	   audio frame sent to the output.
	   - \b mrs_natural/nChannels [r] : number of MIDI tracks in the MIDI file 
	   (also corresponds to the number of individual audio tracks output togheter
	   with the mixed audio)
	   - \b mrs_natural/pos [r]: current playing position (in samples)
	   - \b mrs_bool/hasData [r] : when false, signals the end of the MIDI file
	   - \b mrs_real/start [w] : sets the start of the segment of the MIDI file
	   to be synthesized (in seconds).
	   - \b mrs_real/end [w] : sets the end of the segment of the MIDI file
	   to be synthesized (in seconds).
	   - \b mrs_natural/winSize [w]: when using overlapping analysis windows (which usually
	   make use of a ShiftInput MarSystem somewhere further down in the processing network)
	   this control allows to specify the final analysis window size (since inSamples will
	   correspond to the hop size). This is important to get a correct estimation of the 
	   number of active notes in each analysis window (although only outputting the corresponding
	   hopsize number of audio samples).
	   - \b mrs_bool/sigNewTextWin [w]: sets mode of operation: if true, this MarSystem
	   will use MIDI note onsets to signal texture windows, setting the newTextWin control
	   to true. If set to false, it will accept signals for new texture windows from an outside
	   source (e.g. an onset detector, etc).
	   - \b mrs_bool/newTextWin [rw]: depending on the specified mode (see above), this control
	   will signal a new texture window.
