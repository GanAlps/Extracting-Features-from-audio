/** 
    \class RealvecSource
	\ingroup IO

	A RealvecSource takes a realvec and uses it as a source for your
	MarSystem network.  It is similar to a SoundFileSource except that
	as taking a sound file as the input, it takes a realvec that you
	create as input.

	It is very useful for getting numbers from external sources into
	your Marsystems, for example when reading external files of data.

	It is also very useful when writing tests for your Marsystems.
	You can load up a realvec with data, and then run it through a
	Marsystem to test it.

	When you feed in a realvec, the rows turn into observations and
	the columns turn into samples.
