	\brief Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis (EnhADRess) implementation, 
	which takes a stereo input (i.e. input is expected to be the output of a
	parallel of two Spectrum MarSystems, one for each stereo channel), and
	outputs the magnitudes, phases and panning indexes for N/2+1 bins, 
	stacked vertically:

	[Mag]
	[Phases]
	[Pan]

	This enhanced version of the ADRess algorithm was proposed by Cooney et al,
	"An Enhanced implemantation of the ADRess Music Source Separation Algorithm",
	121st AES Convention, October 2006.
