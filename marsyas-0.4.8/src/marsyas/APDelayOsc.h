	\ingroup Synthesis
	\brief A non-aliasing analog oscillator algorithm

	This is a non-aliasing virtual analog oscillator algorithm.

	For the saw algorithm the output of the fractional delay is fed back into
	the delay line. This creates a perceptually harmonic spectrum that
	approximates having all the harmonics at equal power up to the Nyquist
	frequency.  The saw algorithm ends up having a considerable DC offset, that
	is removed by subtracting frequency/Samplerate from each sample. Finally
	the leaky integrator is used to apply an exponential decay to the frequency
	spectrum.  

	The saw wave is generated in a similar way, but we don't need to worry
	about any DC offset. The only real difference is the square algorithm is
	that we negate the samples as we feed them back into the delay line. This
	will generate a spectrum containing the even harmonics. The one other side
	effect of this as that we double our period, so we must shorten the delay
	line to compensate.

	TODO: Add triangle wave

	TODO: Add ability to modulate pitch.
	          This could be done using two read pointers
			  and a cross fader.
			  It could also be done by changing the delay time
			  at the end of each cycle.
	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/frequency [w] : sets the frequency of the wave.
	- \b mrs_natural/type [w] : sets the oscillator type. (saw = 0, square = 1).
	- \b mrs_bool/noteon [w] : turns on the oscillator
