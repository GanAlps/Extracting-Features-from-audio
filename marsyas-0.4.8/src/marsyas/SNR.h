	\class SNR
	\ingroup Analysis
	\brief Compute SNR and variations

	Computes the SNR between two mono audio signals. 
	One signal is observation 0 and the other is observation 1. 

    The output is:

	observation 0 is the Signal/Noise ratio in dB

	10 * log10(\frac{\sum A^2}{\sum A-B})

	observation 1 is the SNR with optimized gain factor

	10 * log10(\frac{1}{1 - (\frac{sum A B}{\sqrt{\sum A^2 \sum B^2}})})

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_string/mode [rw] : sets the gain multiplier.
