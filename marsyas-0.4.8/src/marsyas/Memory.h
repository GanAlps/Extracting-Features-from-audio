    \brief Memory output the past memSize input observations. 

    Memory is essentially a circular buffer that holds 
	past observations. It used to compute "texture" features 
	-or dynamic features- which are stastics of short-term features 
	-typically around 10-20 milliseconds- over a larger 
	window -around 1 second-.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/memSize [rw] : maximum buffer size (in samples)
	- \b mrs_bool/reset [rw] : clear and reset the memory buffer
