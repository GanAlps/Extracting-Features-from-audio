/** 
    \class KNNClassifier
	\ingroup MachineLearning
    \brief Single KNN multidimensional classifier

   Simple multidimensional KNN classifier. The classifier
parameters (or model) are stored in the the theta control.  When the
mode control is set to "train" the input slice is used to accumulate
information for training.  The actual final theta calculation is
completed when the control train is set to true. That can accomodate
non-incremental or batch training. The labels control is used to
provide ground truth about the label(s). The output of the classifier is
the ground truth label(s) when the mode control is train.

When the mode control is set to "predict" then the output 
of the classifier is the predicted labels using the trained 
parameter vector theta. 

This MarSystems serves as a prototypical classification/regression 
MarSystem.
