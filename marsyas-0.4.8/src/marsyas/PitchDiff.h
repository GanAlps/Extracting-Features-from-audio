	Place this in a series after Yin (or any other
pitch-detection MarSystem), and feed it the expected pitch as a
control.  Outputs the difference as a midi pitch value.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/expectedPitch [w] : expected pitch
	- \b mrs_bool/ignoreOctaves [w] : useful if the pitch
	  detection algorithm has octave errors, but is otherwise
	  relatively accurate (default false)
	- \b mrs_bool/absoluteValue [w] : outputs the absolute
	  difference (default false)
