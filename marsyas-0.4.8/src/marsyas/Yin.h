	\ingroup Analysis
	\brief Pitch detection using the YIN algorithm

	This algorithm was developped by A. de Cheveigne and H. Kawahara and
	published in:
  
	De Cheveigne, A., Kawahara, H. (2002) "YIN, a fundamental frequency
	estimator for speech and music", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1917-1930.  
 
	See http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/pcm/pub/people/cheveign.html

	This code was adapted from aubio (http://aubio.org) by sness.

    THIS MARSYSTEM IS VERY SIMILAR TO AUBIO_YIN, BUT DO NOT DELETE
    IT BECAUSE I NEED IT.  - Graham

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/tolerance [w] : sets the tolerance of the yin algorithm
	- \b mrs_real/frequency_min [w] : limits the search to
      frequencies above or equal to this
	- \b mrs_real/frequency_max [w] : limits the search to
      frequencies below or equal to this (set to 0 to disable)
