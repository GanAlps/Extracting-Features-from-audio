   \class ADRess
   \ingroup Analysis
   \brief Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis (ADRess) implementation,
   which takes a stereo input (i.e. input is expected to be the output of a
   parallel of two Spectrum MarSystems, one for each stereo channel), and
   outputs the phase vector and frequency dependent nulls matrix for 
   each channel using the following format:

   [bin_phases_l][AZl]
   [bin_phases_r][AZr]

   This algorithm was proposed by Dan Barry et al at the DAfX04,
   "Sound Source Separation: azimuth discrimination and resynthesis".
   The algorithm exploits the use of pan pot as a means to achieve image
   localisation within stereophonic recordings, assuming only an interaural
   intensity difference exists between left and right channels for a single
   source. A gain scaling and phase cancellation technique is then used to
   expose frequency dependent nulls across the azimuth domain, from which
   source separation and resynthesis may be  carried out.
