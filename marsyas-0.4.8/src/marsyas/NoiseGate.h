   Simple MarSystem example. Just multiply the values of the input realvec
with NoiseGate and put them in the output vector. This object can be used 
as a prototype template for building more complicated MarSystems.

/* How to use the Limiter Marsystem

	The system can be setup using the marsystem manager
		series->addMarSystem(mng.create("Noisegate", "noisegate"));

	Options: Threshold can be set to any value between 0 and 1
		0 <= thresh <= 1.0	
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/thresh", thresh);
		
	Release threshold is the value where the gate is in the on possition.  This value is usually
	higher than the Threshold value.
		0 <= release <= 1.0
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/release", release);
	
	Rolloff time is the length of time desired for rolloff into noise gate.  This feature allows
	for a smooth transition between the gate being on and the off:
	rolloff = 1 - exp(-2.2*T/t_rolloff)
	where rolloff = rolloff time, T = sampling period, t_rolloff = time parameter 0.001 < t_rolloff < 1 sec
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/at", t_rolloff);
		
	Attack time can be calculated using the following formula: at = 1 - exp(-2.2*T/t_AT)
	where at = attack time, T = sampling period, t_AT = time parameter 0.00016 < t_AT < 2.6 sec
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/at", t_AT);
	
	Release time can be calculated similar to attack time: rt = 1 - exp(-2.2*T/t_RT)
	where rt = release time, T = sampling period, t_RT = time parameter 0.001 < t_RT < 5.0 msec
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/rt", t_RT);
		
	Slope factor: 0 < slope <= 1.0
		series->updctrl("NoiseGate/noisegate/mrs_real/rt", slope);
