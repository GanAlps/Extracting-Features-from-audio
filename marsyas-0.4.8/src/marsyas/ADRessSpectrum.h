   \class ADRessSpectrum
   \ingroup Analysis
   \brief Takes the output of the ADRess (i.e. the stereo azimuth-frequency 
   maps) and outputs a single channel spectrum of the part of the freq-azimuth 
   plane selected by the d and H controls. This can then be 
   inverse transformed back into time domain for resynthesis purposes.

   Controls:
   - \b mrs_real/d		[w] : value between 0.0~1.0, used for selecting the 
   portion of the azimuth-frequency plane to be extracted
   - \b mrs_real/H   [w] : sets the azimuth subspace width 
   (in percentage of total width of the azimuth plane)
