	\class PeakerOnset
	\ingroup Analysis
	\brief Detects if input contains a onset point

	PeakerOnset is based on the onset peak picking algorithm presented in:
	
	Dixon, S. (2006). Onset detection revisited. In Proc. International Conference on Digital 
	Audio Effects (DAFx), Montreal, Canada.

	It takes as input an onset function over time (i.e. a row vector with the times series
	of a onset function like flux) and evaluates a specific point for onset presence, as below:

	Input = [zzzzzzzzzXyyy]

	Point "X" at the input will be evaluated. The onsetWinSize control specifies a "look ahead" parameter,
	i.e. how many samples (represented above as "y") after "X" will be used for evaluating if it is an onset or not (i.e. look ahead samples).

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natrual/lookAheadSamples [w]: specifies the "look ahead" nr of "samples" (the number of "y"s in the above example ) for the detection of an onset at the input.
	- \b mrs_real/threshold [w]: specifies threshold (in % of local mean) for onset detection
	- \b mrs_real/confidence [r]: outputs the confidence that point "X" is an onset (it will 0.0 if it is not detected as an onset)
	- \b mrs_bool/onsetDetected [r]: flags if an onset was detected on point "X".
