	\ingroup Synthesis
	\brief Generates a sine wave.
	
	Creates a sine wave of a chosen frequency using a wave
	guide.

	The frequency can be modulated by using in(0,t). This
	currently doesn't work at audio rates because there is
	amplitude scaling cause when the coefficient k is changed.

	A scaling value could be calculated to compensate for the
	amplitude change.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_real/frequency [w] : the sinewaves frequency in hz.
	- \b mrs_bool/noteon [w] : currently not implemented.
