/** 
    \class CrossCorrelation
	\ingroup Analysis
    \brief Computes the cross correlation of an input.
			
		Accepts N observations and returns N-1 observations, with
		each observation being the cross correlation of the inputs n and n-1.
 
		
		Controls:
		"mrs_string/mode" : This control sets the type of cross correlation.
 
		"general"  is the default, and will compute the generalized cross correlation.
		"phat" will compute the generalized cross correlation with phase transform
		"ml" will compute a maximum likelihood cross correlation.  This works well 
		specifically for time delay estimation in noisy or reverberant environments.
 
		Note: inSamples should be 2^k or fft will not work properly.
