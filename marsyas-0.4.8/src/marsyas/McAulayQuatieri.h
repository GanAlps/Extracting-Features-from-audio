	\class McAulayQuatieri
	\ingroup MarSystem
	\brief Performs McAulay-Quatieri frame-to-frame peak matching

	This MarSystem takes as input a peakView realvec with peak information, and performs McAulay-Quatieri
	frame-to-frame peak matching (i.e. peak continuation), as described in the following paper:

	R. McAulay and T. Quatieri, "Speech analysis/Synthesis based on a sinusoidal representation,"
	IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing vol. 34, pp. 744-754, August 1986.

	Each peak is then associated to a "partial track", whose number ID is stored in the peakView::pkTrack.
	The peak tracking can start from the last frame from the previous texture window received by the Marsystem 
	(when useMemory control is set to true) or perform peak tracking only in the current input peakView. 
	It is also possible to perform peak tracking independently for each cluster (i.e. group) of peaks 
	(for that, set useGroups control to true), in casethey have already been clustered and their 
	peakView::pkGroup field filled correspondingly.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_bool/reset [w]: resets internal memory.
	- \b mrs_bool/useMemory [w] : when true, uses the last frame of the previous input for continuing peak tracking.
	- \b mrs_bool/useGroups [w] : take into consideration the assigned groups (i.e. clusters from NCut) in the input peaks.
