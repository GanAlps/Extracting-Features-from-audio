	\brief Simple MarSystem that shifts samples back in time.

	This is MarSystem is similar to
	- Delay, which can be overkill because it interpolates
	  between delays when they delay is changed.
	- Shifter, which is lame for time shifts because it does not work across
	  slices and shortens the windows size.

	This MarSystem works across slices and with
	delays larger than the window size.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_natural/delay [w] : sets the delay in samples
