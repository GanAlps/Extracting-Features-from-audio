 \class RunningAutocorrelation
 \ingroup Analysis
 \brief Running calculation (across slices) of the autocorrelation values.

 This MarSystem calculates the autocorrelation function of the input signal
 defined by successive input slices. Unlike the AutoCorrelation MarSystem,
 the calculations are done across slice boundaries in a seamless fashion
 (RunningAutocorrelation keeps an internal buffer of the appropriate
 number of samples from previous slices to implement this feature).
 Calculations are done in time domain for time lags from 0 to a user defined
 maximum lag (in number of samples).
 Note that this assumes that the input slices are non overlapping slices.

 The autocorrelation values are laid out in the output slice along the
 time/samples dimension from lag zero to the maximum lag.
 Multiple input observation channels are supported.
 For example, if there are two input channels and the maximum lag is 4,
 the output slice will have two rows and five (not four) columns:
 \f[\begin{array}{ccccc}
 R_{xx}[0] & R_{xx}[1] & R_{xx}[2] & R_{xx}[3] & R_{xx}[4] \\
			R_{yy}[0] & R_{yy}[1] & R_{yy}[2] & R_{yy}[3] & R_{yy}[4] \\
		\end{array}\f]
 with \f$R_{xx}[n]\f$ the autocorrelation of the first channel for lag \f$n\f$
 and \f$R_{yy}[n]\f$ the autocorrelation of the second channel.

 TODO: support overlap between slices (e.g. provide a control for skipping
 a certain amount of samples).

 Controls:
 - \b mrs_natural/maxLag: the maximum time lag (in samples) to calculate
 - \b mrs_bool/normalize: normalize the autocorrelation values on the value
 for lag = 0 (which is the energy of the signal). Note that the
 autocorrelation value for lag 0 will consequently be always 1 (unless
 the input signal is 0 everywhere).
 - \b mrs_bool/doNotNormalizeForLag0: when normalizing the autocorrelation
 values, do not normalize the value for lag 0.
 - \b mrs_bool/clear: clear the internal buffers to start fresh.
 - \b mrs_bool/unfoldToObservations: instead of putting the autocorrelation
 values along the time/samples axis in the slice, they can also be laid
 out along the observation axis. Using the example from above, the output
 slice will have one column and 10 rows with values
 \f$R_{xx}[0], R_{xx}[1], \ldots, R_{xx}[4], R_{yy}[0], R_{yy}[1], \ldots, R_{yy}[4] \f$
