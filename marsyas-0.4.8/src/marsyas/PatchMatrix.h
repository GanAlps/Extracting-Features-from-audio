    \brief Linear Combine Each input channel (i.e. observation) with each other channel
			the weights for the combinations can be provided through the weights control:
			each column of the weights control contains the weight for the input channel (i.e. row)
			with the same number indexwise. Sets of weight for each channel are expected to be found
			within same channel of the weights control.
			A constant vector can also be provided in the consts control to set the offset for each 
			channel respectively.

	Controls:
	- \b mrs_realvec/consts [w] : vector (i.e. one dimensional realvec) of constants 
									each of which is added to its channel.
	- \b mrs_realvec/weights [w] : weights matrix.
