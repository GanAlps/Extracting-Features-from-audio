\brief Calculate simple time domain delta in first order regression fashion.

This Delta calculation is typically used for Delta-MFCC features.

The calculation of the first order regression delta is as follows.
Given a signal \f$x[t]\f$ (discrete time \f$t\f$). For the delta at
time \f$t\f$, we consider the three samples \f$x[t-1]\f$, \f$x[t]\f$ and \f$x[t+1]\f$
and fit a linear function \f$y=a t + b\f$ to these points in the least squares sense.
The slope \f$a\f$ of this function is used as delta \f$\Delta[t]\f$ for time \f$t\f$.
Mathematically, this regression problem with three points at uniform time
point simplifies to a simple calculation \f[\Delta[t] = \frac{x[t+1] - x[t-1]}{2}\f].

This MarSystem uses the calculation above, but adds a time lag of one sample
to make the calculation causal (otherwise we need a sample from the future).

Works with multiple observation channels and works across slices
(the MarSystem keeps an internal buffer of two samples from previous
slice).

This MarSystem has no additional controls.
