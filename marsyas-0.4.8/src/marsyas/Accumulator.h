	\class Accumulator
	\ingroup Composites
	\brief Accumulate result of multiple ticks

	Accumulate result of multiple tick process calls
	to child (i.e internal) MarSystem. Spit output only once when
	all the results are accumulated (either using a predefined
    number of processing ticks or when explicitly "flushed"). 
    Used to change the rate of process requests.

	For example, if \c mode is "countTicks" and \c nTimes is 5, then each time the Accumulator receives
	a tick(), it sends 5 tick()s to the MarSystems that are inside it.

	Controls:
     - \b mrs_string/mode [rw] : in "countTicks" mode accumulates and outputs the result of multiple tick process calls (specified by the value in the \c nTimes control) to the child MarSystem. In "explicitFlush" mode, it keeps accumulating the result of multiple tick process calls to the child MarSystem until the \c flush control is set to true, subsequently sending the accumulated data to the output.
 
	- \b mrs_natural/nTimes [rw] : when in "countTicks" mode, it is the multiplier of ticks() for the
		child (i.e. internal) MarSystem. Ignored in "explicitFlush" mode.
 
    - \b mrs_bool/flush [w] : when in "explicitFlush" mode, setting it to true stops the current accumulator procedure and outputs the accumulated data. Ignored in "countTicks" mode.
 
    - \b mrs_natural/maxTimes [rw] : when in "explicitFlush" mode, this sets the maximum number of times the Accumulator ticks the child MarSystem, in the absence of a flush event (e.g. used to avoid an "infinite" accumulation of data in case a flush event fails to exist). Ignored in "countTicks" mode.
 
    - \b mrs_natural/minTimes [rw] : when in "explicitFlush" mode, this sets the minimum number of times the Accumulator ticks the child MarSystem, even in the presence of a flush event (e.g. used to set a minimum "distance" between consecutive flushes). Ignored in "countTicks" mode.
 
    - \b mrs_natural/timesToKeep [rw] : when in "explicitFlush" mode, this control specifies the number of tick (i.e processing)results output by the child MarSystem that will not be output when a flush event is issued, being instead kept internally for the next accumulator tick. E.g., in some usage scenarios (e.g. onset detection), the decision to flush the accumulator may need some additional data (i.e. ticks) before the flush event is issued. In such cases, the \c timesToKeep control allows the specify how many ticks "into the future" it will need to accumulate in order to be able to decide a flush. In such a case, the onset event (which should correspond to a flush to the accumulator) should have benen issued "timesToKeep" ticks ago... a way to achieve that is to output the accumulated data minus the last "timesToKeep" ticks, which will be held internally for the next accumulation process. A graphical example, where each dot (".") represents an accumulated output from the child MarSystem, and the X is a special output where some flush decision should be made:
 
        ..........X.
        
        So, having the graphic above in mind, supose we have an Accumulator in "explicitFlush", with a child onset detector MarSystem that at each tick, looks at its previous output and compares it to the current one, deciding if an onset existed one output ago (so, it need to look one output into the future - which is the current one! - to be able to decide). In case it determines an onset occured one output ago (marked as X in the picture above), it sets an "onset deteted" control (which should be linked to the \c flush control in the parent Accumulator), making the Accumulator to stop accumulating and output the accumulated data till the detected onset. However, if the \c timesToKeep value is set to zero, the Accumulator will output the entire accumulated data, and usually in such an onset detection scenario, it would be more interesting to have it just output the data till the detected onset, keeping the remaining data for further accumulation. The way to achieve that is to specifiy a non-zero value to the \c timesToKeep control, which in the current example could be set to 2 (i.e. both the previous and current data outputs will be kept internally, and all the previous accumulated data output - we could call it the pre-onset data).
