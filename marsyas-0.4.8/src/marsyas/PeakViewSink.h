\class PeakViewSink
\ingroup IO
\brief This MarSystem accumulates realvecs with peak information (using peakView) 
arriving at its input and when receiving a "done" control trigger, saves the peak data
to the specified file in .peak format.

Controls:
- \b mrs_string/filename [w] : specifies the name of the file to where the accumulated 
peak data will be saved.
- \b mrs_bool/accumulate2Disk [w] : specifies if the peak data accumulation should be 
performed using a temporary disk file ("true") or accumulate peak data in memory ("false").
- \b mrs_real/fs [w]: sampling frequency associated with peak data (will be saved in the 
.peak file header).
- \b mrs_natural/frameSize [w]: frame size (in samples) associated with the peak data 
(will be saved in the .peak file header).
- \b mrs_bool/done [w] : "trigger" this control to "true" to save accumulated peak data 
to the specified file and reset accumulated peak memory (disk or memory).
