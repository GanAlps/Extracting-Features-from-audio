	observation channel.

	This MarSystem averages its input channels (the different observation
	rows of a slice) to a single output channel. The weights for the
	averaging are determined automatically based on the number of input
	channels, so it works intuitively for mono, stereo or input with more
	channels.

	\see Sum.

	This MarSystem has no extra controls.
