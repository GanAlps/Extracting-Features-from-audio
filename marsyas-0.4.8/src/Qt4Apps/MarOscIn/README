MarOscIn
--------

* Overview

  MarOscIn is a tiny little Marsyas Qt based application that reads in
  OSC messages that are sent to port 9000 to the OSC address
  "/gainSlider" and changes the value of the QSlider "gainSlider"
  based on the value in the contents of the OSC message.

* How it works

  1) First of all start the little Python program
     "send-out-to-gain.py":

	 ./send-out-to-gain.py
	 
	 - This program will send out a message every 1 second to
       port 9000.  The contents of the message will alternate between
       "0" and "100".

  2) In another window, start MarOscIn like this;

	 ./MarOscIn file.wav


  MarOscIn will listen to port 9000 and any messages that are sent to
  the /gainSlider address will change the gainSlider.
