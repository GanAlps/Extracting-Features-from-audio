MarPlayer 
--------

Simple soundfile player that can be used as a template 
for building GUIs in Qt 4 that connect to the Marsyas 
audio processing framework. The code requires 
that Qt 4.0 or later is installed in your system 
and has only been tested on Linux systems. Of course 
Marsyas 0.2.1 or later must also installed. 


To compile: 

qmake 
make 
MarPlayer 



Files: 
MarPlayer.h MarPlayer.cpp : loads the designer created forms and 
			    connects the GUI widgets to appropriate 
			    slots of Mapper 

Mapper.h Mapper.cpp       : Maps the various signals generated 
			    by the GUI widgets to corresponding 
			    calls to a MarSystemQtWrapper that 
			    contains a MarSystem network 
			    that plays files 

MarSystemQtWrapper.h MarSystemQtWrapper.cpp: in parent directory.  These
   files are common to every Qt/Marsyas application; you don't need to
   understand these files.
