MarGrid 
--------

Creates a grid where soundfiles can be placed 
based on automatic feature extraction and content-based 
similarity. Currently uses the Self-Organizing Map 
MarSystem. Other methods will be investigated 
in the future. 

The code requires 
that Qt 4.0 or later is installed in your system 
and has only been tested on Linux systems. Of course 
Marsyas 0.2.2 or later must also installed. 


To compile: 

qmake 
make 
MarGrid
