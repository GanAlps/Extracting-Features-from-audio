MarOscOut
--------

* Overview

  MarOscOut is a tiny little Marsyas Qt based application that sends
  out OSC messages to port 9001 based on the current position of the
  QSlider gainSlider.  The messages are of the form:

  ['/mrs_real/gain', ',f', 0.0]


* How it works

  1) First of all start the small Python program that receives the
  messages:

    ./receive-from-MarOscOut.py
	
  2) You can test this program with the other supplied Python sending
  program:

    ./test-send-osc.py

	 - This program will send out a message every 1 second to
       port 9001.  The contents of the message will alternate between
       "0" and "100".
	 - Once you're statisfied that the ./receive-from-MarOscOut.py
       program is receiving messages correctly, terminate the
       ./test-send-osc.py program.  

  3) In another window, start MarOscOut like this;

	 ./MarOscOut file.wav

  MarOscOut will send out OSC messages to port 9001, the contents of
  this message will be the current value of the gainSlider.
