In order to compile externals for Max/MSP, the Max/MSP/Jitter SDK is required.
You can download it from http://cycling74.com/products/sdk/ [Tested with both v5.1.7 and v6.04]

After download unzip the MaxSDK-x.x.x package in your local machine

OSX 32-bit:

[Tested in 10.6 with gcc 4.2 for i386 and x86_64]
Only working with static linking to the Marsyas lib

1. Configure the Marsyas Max/MSP with CMake:
	- Configure for XCode
	- Enable WITH_MAX/MSP and MARSYAS_STATIC in cmake-gui
	- Press Configure
	- Select the main path of your MaxSDK-x.x.x folder as the MAXSDK_MAINPATH
	- Press Configure twice
	- Press Generate

2. Build using XCode [Tested with XCode v3.0]
	- Open path_to_build_of_your_marsyas/marsyas.xcodeproj
	- In the ibt_ project info change the "Packaging/Product Name" from "ibt_" to "ibt~" [CMake doesn't support the "~" character so this should be hard-defined at this stage]
	- Rename the ibt_ project name to ibt~
	- Build libmarsyas.a and ibt~.mxo in Release mode

3. Add external and help file to your Max/MSP search path [Tested with Max 5 and Max 6]

	- copy the ibt~.mxo in path_to_build_of_marsyas/bin/Release/ to /Applications/Max/Cycling'74/max-externals/
	- copy the ibt~.maxhelp in path_to_marsyas/src/marsyas_max-msp/max-help/ to /Applications/Max/Cycling'74/max-help/

4. Open ibt~.maxhelp to test the IBT Max/MSP external
