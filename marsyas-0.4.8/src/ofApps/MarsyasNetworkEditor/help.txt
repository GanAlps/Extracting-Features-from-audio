Instructions for building Openframeworks projects including Marsyas framework

0 - Get the latest Xcode version from Apple developer website

1 - get OpenFrameworks v0071 from:
http://www.openframeworks.cc

2 - get the latest Marsyas from the SVN:
www.marsyas.info

3 - Build Marsyas using CMAKE with the following configuration:
    * -> CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES = i386
    * -> MARSYAS_MIDIIO = false
    * -> MARSYAS_STATIC = true

4 - open the Terminal and navigate to the folder you used to build Marsyas with CMAKE and do the following commands as superuser:
	make
	make install
    
5 - Build a new Xcode project based on the OpenFrameworks AllAddonsExample or emptyExample that comes with the OF 0.072 distribution

6 - On the project Build Settings include the path: /usr/local/lib in the Lybrary search path item (for both release and debug).

7 - Include the generated libmarsyas.a and all Marsyas header files in the project
The easiest way is to do:
	In finder use the "Go to Folder…" option at the Go menu item.
	Go to folder: /usr/local/lib
        Drag and drop the libmarsyas.a file to your Xcode project and set the "Copy items into destination group´s" to false.
	Do the same thing for /usr/local/include/marsyas folder.
