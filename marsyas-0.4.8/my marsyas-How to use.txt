Firstly, Download Marsyas from 
http://marsyas.info/

Or just use my folder named marsyas-0.4.8

and install it using instructions on
http://marsyas.info/assets/docs/manual/marsyas-user/Source-installation.html

If you downloaded the marsyas sustem from website.
Replace the following file
marsyas-0.4.8/src/apps/helloWorld/helloWorld.cpp
with the same-one in my folder.

This helloWorld.cpp will be compiled automatically with the
sudo make
instruction. after you replace the file do compile it once more by
cd marsyas-0.4.8/build/
sudo make

Once you are done with this you will have an executable file:
marsyas-0.4.8/build/bin/helloWorld

as you are in build directory. use command
sudo ./bin/helloWorld InputFile.wav

and you will be able to see output features as well as real time playing audio.

Further for internal details about marsyas systema and my helloWorld.cpp see marsyas-internal_details.txt
