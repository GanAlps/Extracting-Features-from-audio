Download LibXtract from
http://libxtract.sourceforge.net/

Install it using instructions in "readme.md"

Now, I integrated library libsndfile with it to read sudio files.
Install libsndfile by command
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1

Then add
LIBS = -lsndfile
to following MakeFile:
LibXtract-master/examples/simpletest/MakeFile

Replace simpletest.c by simpletest.c created by me.

now open terminal change directory to LibXtract-master and type
sudo make
sudo make install

now you will have an executable file in examples/simpletest/
you can run this with an audio file as input and get feature vectors.

Basic concept of LibXtract is the output of one feature can be given as input to other to save time. Thus is first have features that takes samples as input then features that take spectrum as input and then some features take harmonics as input and there are some other that take previous features as input thus the order of feature extraction can not be varied independently.

In My simpletest.c I have a main function that just uses libsndfile and reads the input wav file and give us samples in variable named waveTable.
Now, I send this samples chunk by chunk to function extractall() which returns me the feature vector.
