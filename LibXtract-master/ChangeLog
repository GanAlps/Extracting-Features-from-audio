2008-3-26 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.6.0
	* Fixed build fail if --enable-fft not specified
	* Fixed doxygen build so that it includes libxtract.h
	* Doxygen tweaks

2008-2-16 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.6.0
	* Added to pd example the ability to differentiate between different
	argv types (XTRACT_FLOAT, XTRACT_INT) and pass the correct data type
	to the xtract[]() function
	* Added xtract_flatness_db() details to descriptors.c
	* Fixes to tonality and xtract_subbands descriptors
	* Added Pd examples for 'subband mean' and tonality calculated using subbands

2008-2-15 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.5.9
	* Fixed bugs in xtract_flatness(), or at least added necessary
	documentation and error checking to avoid problems
	* Added xtract_is_denormal() helper function and XTRACT_DENORMAL_FOUND
	return code
	* Replaced all instances of log, sqrt, exp etc. with respective
	floating point counterparts (logf etc.)
	* Added check for architecture endianness to configure script
	* Bug fix to PD example, now no longer crashes if no arguments are
	given
	* Minor documentation updates

2007-10-09 Dan Stowell
    * version 0.5.1
        * Fixed bug in xtract_init_mfcc() which accidentally missed filling in the very top filter frequency value

2007-10-06 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.5.0
	* Removed fftw_plan creation from inner loop of functions that use fft
	* Added new init function xtract_init_fft() for initialisation of
	fft_plan out-of-place. The actual plans have global scope, and are
	freed by the library destructor.
	* Updated Max/MSP and PD examples too reflect the above change
	* Made the fft optimistation level a compile-time option through
	--with-fft-optimisation flag (0 = lowest, 2 = highest).
	* Minor fixes.

2007-10-04 Dan Stowell
    * version 0.4.9
	* Fixed and tidied MFCC functions

2007-09-04 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.8
	* Added cursory SWIG Python wrapper generator

2007-04-20 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.7
	* Added MSP example
	
2007-04-20 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.5
	* Fixed autocorrelation_fft()
	* Added MAINTAINERCLEAN files to Makefile.am 

2007-03-14 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.4
	* Fixed return value macros for functions if fftw not used
	* Fixed bug in xtract_spectrum() FFTW_R2HC not interpreted correctly

2007-01-29 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.4.0
	* Added namespacing for macros and enumerations
	* Made most macros private
	* Rationalised formats for data (*data and argv) to create consistency
	between functions
	* Added spectral_mean() and friends
	* Added feature descriptors (see libxtract.h/descriptors.c

2006-12-15 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.4
	* Changed xtract_lowest_match(), to xtract_lowest(). It just returns the
	lowest non-zero component in the input array, between two bounds
	* qualified int *data, int N, and void *argv as const, thus insuring
	that they won't be modified by the called function.
	* added facilities for some functions to operate on copies of input
	data instead of modifying it. This will need to be optimised at some
	point maybe.
	* Added arguments to spectral flatness to allow for control over input
	band and pre-scaling
	* Fixed confusing xtract_init_mfcc() parameter order
	* Added new xtractor xtract_failsafe_f0

2006-12-12 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.3
	* Fixed errors in skewnes, kurtosis, irregularity_k, irregularity_j,
	tristimulus_1, tristimulus_2, and tristimulus_3.
	* Tested the above
	* Changed rolloff so output is in Hz. This means that a second
	argument (samplerate) needs to be passed in as argv[1]
2006-12-11 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.2
	* changed xtract_inharmonicity so that it takes frequencies AND
	amplitudes of peaks from *data rather than via *argv. This is
	consistent with xtract_centroid and others, and it means the data can
	come directly from xtract_peaks
	* Improvements to pd example (fixed memory allocation bugs)
2006-12-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.1
	* Fixed xtract_init_mfcc (array entries zeroed out if not set)
2006-11-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.3.0
	* Corrected typos in scalar.c
	* Added -Wall to CFLAGS and corrected problems relating to warnings
	* Added xtract_harmonics and corresponding documentation
2006-11-10 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.2.2
	* Fixed 'bus error' crash on Mac OS X by adding 'extern' declarations
	to xtract and xtract_help_strings	
2006-10-24 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * version 0.2.1
	* Fixed _xtract and _xtract_help_strings memory alloc bug
	* Added new macro
	_

	* improved xtract_f0
	* changed versioning scheme

2006-10-09 Jamie Bullock <jamie@postlude.co.uk>
    * Released version 0.11
