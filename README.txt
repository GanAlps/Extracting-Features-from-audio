#Exatraction of features from audio

This is a part of work I did at HLTC lab, HKUST in Summer 2014 under Prof. Dekai WU.
This work tries to extract all/maximum possible features from any audio file (or from mic in realtime in opensmile). I used three libraries namely, opensmile, marsyas and libxtract independently. openSmile does extraction in real-time.

I hope this work will help people to extract features from audio files or real-time streaming audio. This will save your time in editing these libraries to get expected features out of it.
It is very easy here to remove or comment few lines of code and get only the required features.

All libraries had their own restriction which you can see in respective folders.
