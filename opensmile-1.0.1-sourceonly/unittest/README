This directory contains two sets of unittests for openSMILE:
  A) Various configurations are tested against various real audio files.
  B) Various components are tested against series of test values (component-tests)

(B) is not yet implemented but will follow soon. All stable components should be nonetheless covered by the tests in the set (A).

To run the tests you must have compiled openSMILE and have a running binary in ../SMILExtract

You can then run: 
  sh init_tests.sh
to unpack the samples and references

and then 
  perl do_tests.sh

to perform the tests and evaluate the result. This script will create a file called 'test.log' which contains the detailed evaluation result.
